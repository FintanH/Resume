    "summary": "I am an experienced software engineer with a strong emphasis on backend development. In the last 3 years I've worked on handling of market data, writing driver software and developing internal tools at SIG and building the improved logo detection stack from the ground up at LogoGrab, a Dublin-based startup. My tasks at LogoGrab involve writing functional style and efficient Python, C and Scala code, management of AWS deployments via OpsWorks, SQS and EC2, writing tools for automating work flow for AWS and providing support to our range of customers. I work best in teams that collaborate on projects and foster a positive workplace environment. As a team member, I enjoy work that not only challenges me, but also requires me to learn new things while refining the skills I already have.",
